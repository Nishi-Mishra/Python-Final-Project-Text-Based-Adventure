# Python-Final-Project-Text-Based-Adventure

Our project is a text adventure. This game involvea gaining loot which puts the user in a better position to advance through the levels. In our program the user gains loot to buy better armor and weapons.

The basic idea for our game is the user will have access to a shop to buy weapons, armor, and healing to protect themselves while in the dungeon. In the shop the user can buy these items using the loot they have obtained throughout the game. When in the dungeon the user will encounter several events. These events include loot drops, sayings, and monster fights. These events will be randomized so the user will encounter multiple of each event in a single level. 

The loot drops are when the user can get more money to buy items from the shop. Sayings are strings of words printed to the console that are used to immerse the user into the game. Finally, the monster battles are when the user is faced with an opponent and is promoted to input a combination of attacks and/or defenses until the opponent's health is depleted. 

There are a total of 20 levels in this game. After each level, the user will be able to buy new items from the shop to use in the following levels. In addition, the monster fights will progressively get harder each level.

The goal of this game is to collect loot, upgrade your armor, and fight off monsters until you have completed level 20.
